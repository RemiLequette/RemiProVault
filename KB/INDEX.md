# Knowledge Base Index

## Quick Start

**Why:** Every AI-assisted session needs consistent conventions. This file is the single entry point to the Knowledge Base (KB) — loaded at the start of every session on instruction from the project's AI agent configuration.

**What:** A navigation map. Does not contain knowledge — points to it. Two catalogues: `conventions/` (rules for doing things) and `guides/` (step-by-step processes). A Decision Layer maps the current task to the files to load.

**How:** At session start, read the Session Bootstrap below. During the session, consult the Decision Layer to load only what the task requires.

---

## Session Bootstrap

Steps to follow at the start of every session, in order.

1. Read `public/guides/how-to-get-things-done.md` — session model and working practice.
2. Read `public/conventions/todo-list.md` — TODO and WIP file structure.
3. Read `PROJECT.md` at the project root — project context, current objective, WIP.
4. Apply the Scope Rule below.
5. Use the Decision Layer to identify and load the conventions relevant to the current task.
6. Greet the user by name, state the active project, and confirm you are ready.

---

## AI Agents

Agent-specific instructions. Apply only for the active agent.

| Agent | Specificities |
|-------|---------------|
| Claude | None |

---

## Scope Rule — Mandatory

**Never access files or directories outside the active project folder without explicit user request.**

This includes:
- Listing sibling project folders
- Reading files in other projects
- Inferring context from other projects

**Exception:** The Knowledge Base folder is accessible **read-only** — load only what the decision layer instructs.

WHY: Prevents context pollution, unnecessary file reads, and unintended exposure of unrelated projects.

---

## Decision Layer — What to read

To identify what type of document to read, ask: what would you need to audit it?
- Artifacts → convention
- A log → guide

Match the current task against the triggers below. Read only the documents that match.

| Trigger | Load |
|---------|------|
| Creating or editing a `.md` file | `conventions/documentation.md`, `conventions/documentation-style.md` |
| Declaring a document type, auditing content style | `conventions/documentation-style.md` |
| SQL query, database read/write, schema change | `conventions/sqlite.md` |
| CommWise layout, CSS, flex, viewport constraints | `conventions/commwise-layout.md` |
| CommWise modal, overlay, disabled button | `conventions/commwise-modals.md` |
| CommWise block read/write, assembly, synchronisation | `conventions/commwise-framework.md` |
| Modular architecture (Core, IService, Assembly, Framework) | `conventions/modular-architecture.md` |
| Architecture of a time-tracked structured dataset (artifact) | `conventions/artifact.md` |
| Project uses input channels to import ideas (email, Notion, etc.) | `conventions/idea-inbox.md` |
| Registering a project, querying project dependencies, posting or triaging cross-project ideas | `conventions/project-registry.md` |
| Live DOM debug, JS validation in browser | `conventions/claude-chrome-mcp.md` |
| Complex analysis, structured reasoning, multi-step problem | `conventions/claude-structured-reasoning.md` |
| `file://` HTML page with persistent storage | `conventions/indexeddb-file-protocol.md` |
| Setting up or using the local development server | `conventions/local-server.md` |
| Creating or auditing a GLOSSARY.md | `conventions/glossary.md` |
| Node.js automation script, cross-project tool | `conventions/tools.md` |
| Creating or managing a TODO.md or backlog | `conventions/todo-list.md` |
| Writing a Journal entry or a Changelog entry, migrating inline changelogs | `conventions/journal-changelog.md` |
| Setting up or auditing Claude project structure or instructions | `conventions/project-structure.md` |
| Setting up a new Claude project | `guides/project-setup-process.md` |
| Auditing a project for conformance | `guides/audit-process.md` |
| Updating a guide file | `guides/guide-maintenance.md` |
| Building or setting up the HTML todo list tool | `guides/todo-tool.md`, `conventions/todo-list.md`, `conventions/local-server.md` |


---

## conventions/

Rules and patterns governing how something is done. A convention leaves a trace in the artifacts — conformance is auditable by examining documents, code, or data directly. Load only what the current task requires (use the Decision Layer above). A task may require more than one convention.

## guides/

Step-by-step processes for specific operations. A guide leaves a trace in the process — auditing whether it was followed requires a log. Read when performing the named operation, not at every session.

| File | Summary | Keywords |
|------|---------|----------|

---

## tools/

Deterministic artifacts that execute mechanical tasks without consuming AI reasoning. Two types: **scripts** (see `conventions/tools.md`) and **viewers/editors** (see `guides/editor-tool.md`). A tool leaves a trace in both artifacts (it exists) and execution (it was run, with a result).

## Changelog

### Version 3.9 - Forge references removed
**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Reason:** Forge abandoned — too abstract, AI Assistants could not use it reliably. All references removed. Changelog entries kept with notes for traceability.

**Modifications:**
- Decision Layer: sentence "Use Forge to read all KB documents." removed
- Table conventions/: entry `forge.md` removed
- Table guides/: entry `working-with-forge.md` removed
- Changelog v3.8: note "Forge abandoned" added

---

### Version 3.8 - working-with-forge.md recreated + Session Bootstrap updated
**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Reason:** Guide recreated for Forge v2 — minimal, no architecture, focused on path format and read/write decision. Decision reversed from v3.6: describes alone are insufficient — the global decision flow and path format require a dedicated guide. Added to Session Bootstrap (step 2) so it is loaded at every session.

**Modifications:**
- Session Bootstrap: step 2 added — `working-with-forge.md`; steps 3–7 renumbered
- Table guides/: entry `working-with-forge.md` added (first row)

*Note: Forge abandoned — 2026-06-20. See v3.9.*

---

### Version 3.7 - gemini-cli.md added to guides/
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Reason:** New guide for Gemini CLI — human-facing only, no Decision Layer trigger (choosing which AI to use is a human decision, not an AI Assistant trigger).

**Modifications:**
- Table guides/: entry `gemini-cli.md` added

---

### Version 3.6 - working-with-forge.md supprimé de la table guides/
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Reason:** Décision session : les MCP tool describes doivent se suffire à eux-mêmes — pas de guide opérationnel séparé. Le trigger avait déjà été retiré en v3.4. Entrée de table retirée. Voir TODO O52 pour la suppression du fichier et l'amélioration des describes.

**Modifications:**
- Table guides/: entrée `working-with-forge.md` retirée

---

### Version 3.5 - FAL removed
**Date:** 2026-06-11
**Reason:** FAL is a concept from Forge v1 — not present in the current codebase or spec.

**Modifications:**
- Decision Layer: `— \`forge_read(fal)\`` removed from intro line
- Table conventions/: `forge.md` summary rewritten — `FAL syntax` → `format registry`; keywords `FAL, namespace, RTFM, internal-spec` removed
- Table guides/: `working-with-forge.md` summary rewritten — `FAL concept, RTFM workflow (describe before read/write)` → `tool reference, common patterns`; keywords `FAL, RTFM, forge_describe` removed

---

### Version 3.4 - working-with-forge.md trigger removed
**Date:** 2026-06-11
**Reason:** `working-with-forge.md` describes Forge v1 (FAL, RTFM, Brand, forge_describe) — incompatible with Forge v2. Trigger removed from Decision Layer to prevent loading an obsolete guide. Table entry kept for traceability. See TODO O52.

**Modifications:**
- Decision Layer: trigger `Using Forge to read or write artifacts, first session with Forge` removed

---
